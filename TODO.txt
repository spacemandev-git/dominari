## Future Features
    - Set Game DAO Fee for initalization and builder harvests
    - Close Player Account? (Will lose points information...)
    - Name locations and name Troops
    - WIN Condition: Hold Location for X Seconds
    - Lootable Feature that gives you X points every time you activate it (allow Builder to specify a player account and instead of it costing $, every time it's activated it shares poitns with the Builder and the Player that built it?)
        - Maybe Builder points allow them to collect percentage of the pot at the end.
        - Could be that scorable features can only be debug built by admin. Allow for them to exist on the 3rd layer, and randomly get created/destroyed all over the map
